This Verilog-based traffic light controller is designed to manage traffic flow at a crossroad, prioritizing a busy main street while accommodating less frequently used side roads. The system sequences traffic lights with predefined delays to ensure smooth traffic flow and minimize congestion. The design is developed and validated using Xilinx Vivado. By optimizing signal timing and light transitions, the project enhances traffic management at intersections, leading to improved vehicle throughput and reduced wait times for side streets, promoting overall road safety and efficiency.
