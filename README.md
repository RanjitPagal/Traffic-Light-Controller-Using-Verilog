This Verilog-based traffic light controller is designed to manage traffic flow at a crossroad, prioritizing a busy main street while accommodating less frequently used side roads. The system sequences traffic lights with predefined delays to ensure smooth traffic flow and minimize congestion. Control logic was developed and validated using Xilinx Vivado, an industry-standard tool for FPGA design, ensuring reliability and efficiency in real-world scenarios. By optimizing signal timing and light transitions, the project enhances traffic management at intersections, leading to improved vehicle throughput and reduced wait times for side streets, promoting overall road safety and efficiency.
